# Fingerprint Classifier

## Problem Definition
Zone classification of location of a customer in a store using fingerprints received by implemented sensors 

The problem is classification of zone which a user is currently at, based on received signals from her mobile phone by the installed sensors (nodes). Input includes received signals for each customer from each sensor, plus mac id of the mobile phone and the time stamp of the received signals.
In this repository, the designed solution, developed python code, analysis and discussion on the results are provided.

## Provided files:
File **'Fingerprint to Zone Classification.ipynb'**: A complete notebook including code sections, explanations of the solution and related plots of the project

File **'sample_input'** provide a sample dataset to determine the input format (note that values of this sample has been genereated randomly). 

Folder **'Code_fingerprint_classifier'**: four .py files which are the implemented code that can be run  (The codes are not different from 'Fingerprint to Zone Classification.ipynb' notebook file)

Folder **'plot_files'** provides the plots for the notebookd file 'Fingerprint to Zone Classification.ipynb'
