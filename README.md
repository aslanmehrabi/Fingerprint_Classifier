# Fingerprint Classifier

## Problem Definition
Zone classification of location of a customer in a store using fingerprints received by implemented sensors 

The problem is classification of zone which a user is currently at, based on received signals from her mobile phone by the installed sensors (nodes). Input includes received signal for each customer from each sensor, plus mac_id of the mobile phone and the time stamp of received signals.
In this repository, the designed solution, developed python code, and analysis and discussion on the results are provided.

## Provided files:
File **'Fingerprint to Zone Classification.ipynb'**: A complete notebook including code sections, explanations of the solution and related plots of the project
File **'sample_input'** provide a sample dataset to determine the input format (note that values of this sample has been genereated randomly). 
Folder **'Code_fingerprint_classifier'**: four .py files which are the implemented code that can be run  (The codes are not different from 'Fingerprint to Zone Classification.ipynb' notebook file)
Folder **'plot_files'** provides the plots for the notebookd file 'Fingerprint to Zone Classification.ipynb'
